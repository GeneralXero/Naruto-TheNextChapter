This is how +sheet will look (without color)

                                ~ Character Sheet ~

This is how +sheet/help will look (words will wrap to the person's client)

This is the sheet system! This allows you to see various stats on your character
as well as the different skills your character can use. It also displays your
character's merits and flaws. Here is a breakdown of the commands
(what you type is in this color):

+sheet: This shows you the full sheet! Skills, stats, merits and flaws are all here!

+sheet/share <name>: This allows you to share your sheet with <name>, with <name>
being the name of a player on this MUSH.

+sheet/stats: This will make it so you will only see you stats
(Nin, Gen, Tai, Mind, Body, Spirit).

+sheet/skills: This command will allow for you to only look at what
skills are available to you.
